## Overview of my backend devlopment workspace
This repository is my digital notebook for tracking projects I create, things I have learned, and useful references for this course.

## Learning Objectives for the Course
- Build a strong understanding of backend development concepts and practices.
- Gain hands-on experience with SQL, APIs, and scripting languages.
- Improve my Git workflow, including commits, branching, and version control best practices.
- Develop the ability to document and organize projects effectively.
- Apply debugging, testing, and performance optimization techniques to real projects.

## How I Plan to Use This Repository Throughout the Semester
- Track all projects and exercises from each unit by organizing them into their respective folders.
- Maintain a learning log to document new skills, insights, and areas for improvement.
- Store useful resources, tutorials, and references in a central location for easy access.
- Create a personal Git reference file to build a cheat sheet for commands and workflows.
- Use commits to clearly show the evolution of my work and understanding over the semester.
